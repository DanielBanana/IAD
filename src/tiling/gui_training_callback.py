"""
Lightning Callback that reports tiled-ensemble training progress to the GUI.

Doesn't touch or replace the console's own TQDMProgressBar -- this is a
second, independent reporter hooked into the same Lightning training loop,
alongside whatever other callbacks (EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, ...)
the trainer config already lists. Reports through
console.commandDispatcher.post_worker_update, the same channel every other
worker-to-GUI fact in this app goes through (console/ is on sys.path
alongside AnomalyDetection/src, same as every other cross-package import in
this app -- see gui_main.py/cli_main.py's own sys.path setup); GUI.py's
_onTrainProgress is what consumes it (two progress bars: tiles overall, and
epochs within whichever tile is currently training).

class GUITrainingProgressCallback(Callback):
    """Reports per-epoch/per-tile training progress via
    post_worker_update("progress", ...).

    Tiled-ensemble training builds a fresh Trainer per tile (see
    AOITiledEnsembleEngine._setup_anomalib_callbacks in
    tiling/ensemble_engine.py), but that method only replaces callback
    *types* it has a registered adjuster for -- everything else, this
    callback included, passes through unchanged as the same instance on
    every tile. That's what lets it track tile count across the whole run
    instead of resetting itself every tile.

    total_tiles doesn't need to be set by hand for a tiled-ensemble run:
    it's not knowable at YAML-parse time (this callback is instantiated
    from the trainer config alone, well before anything reads the tiling
    config), but AOITiledEnsembleEngine *does* know it by the time it
    actually builds each tile's Trainer -- ensemble_engine.py registers a
    GUITrainingProgressCallback adjuster (see _adjust_gui_progress_callback)
    that sets it from the tiler's real tile count automatically, in place,
    before every tile trains. The init_arg below only matters for a
    non-tiled (single-model) run, where total_tiles=1 is simply correct
    and there's no engine to override it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    total_tiles : int, optional
        How many tiles this run will train, in total. Defaults to 1 (a
        non-tiled run); tiled-ensemble runs get this overwritten
        automatically -- see class docstring above.
