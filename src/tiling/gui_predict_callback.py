"""
Lightning Callback that reports tiled-ensemble prediction progress to the GUI.

Mirrors gui_training_callback.py's GUITrainingProgressCallback, but for the
predict phase: a tiled-ensemble predict run never calls trainer.fit() (see
InferenceJob.run in tiling/tiled_ensemble.py, which calls engine.predict()
directly), so this reacts to the predict loop's own hooks
(on_predict_start/on_predict_batch_end/on_predict_end) instead of the fit
loop's. Reports through console.commandDispatcher.post_worker_update under
its own "predict_progress" kind -- same channel training progress uses, kept
separate so the GUI doesn't have to guess which run a "progress" update
belongs to. GUI.py's _onPredictProgress is what consumes it.

class GUIPredictProgressCallback(Callback):
    """Reports per-batch/per-tile prediction progress via
    post_worker_update("predict_progress", ...).

    Tiled-ensemble prediction builds a fresh Trainer per tile (one
    InferenceJob per tile location -- see InferenceJobGenerator.generate_jobs
    in tiling/tiled_ensemble.py), but every tile's InferenceJob is handed the
    same trainer_args dict for the whole predict run (InferenceTiledEnsemble.run
    builds it once via _pipeline_trainer_kwargs and reuses it across every
    tile), so this callback instance -- like GUITrainingProgressCallback's --
    passes through unchanged tile to tile. That's what lets it track tile
    count across the whole run instead of resetting itself every tile.

    total_tiles doesn't need to be set by hand: it's not knowable at
    YAML-parse time (this callback is instantiated from the inferencer
    config alone), but InferenceJobGenerator does know it by the time it
    builds each tile's InferenceJob -- ensemble_engine.py registers a
    GUIPredictProgressCallback adjuster (see
    _adjust_gui_predict_progress_callback) that sets it from the tiler's
    real tile count automatically, in place, before every tile predicts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    total_tiles : int, optional
        How many tiles this run will predict, in total. Defaults to 1 (a
        non-tiled run); tiled-ensemble runs get this overwritten
        automatically -- see class docstring above.
