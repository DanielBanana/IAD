"""
Canonical, manager-owned conventions for where a tiled-ensemble training run's artifacts
live on disk, and how its per-tile identifiers are named.

These live in their own module rather than on ``AnomalyDetectionManager`` in manager.py:
manager.py imports from ``tiling.tiled_ensemble``, which imports from
``tiling.ensemble_engine`` - if ensemble_engine.py imported these conventions back from
manager.py, that would be a circular import. Keeping them here lets manager.py, the tiled
ensemble pipeline, and the engine all depend on one shared source of truth instead of each
re-deriving (or hardcoding) the same paths/names independently.
